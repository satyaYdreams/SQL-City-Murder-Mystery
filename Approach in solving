The initial thought is to retrieve the crime_scene_report of the particular murder by using where clause with the given information about the murder

select*
from crime_scene_report
where type='murder' and city='SQL City' and date =20180115

Result:- 

 date      	 type	                                                 description	                                                            city
20180115	  murder	Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr".   SQL City
                                               The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".	
                                               
                                              
My immediate response after finding the information about the two witnesses is to inner join interview table and person table on person id and id,
using where clause for address as below

select*
from interview
join person
on interview.person_id=person.id
where address_street_name='Northwestern Dr' or address_street_name='Franklin Ave';

However this query resulted in all the people with those addresses which is of no use.

Changed my approach this time with same query as above but little modification in where clause as below:

select*
from interview
join person
on interview.person_id=person.id
where name like '%Annabel%' and  address_street_name='Franklin Ave';

Result:- 

person_id             	transcript	           id	      name     	license_id	 address_number	address_street_name	    ssn
16371   	      I saw the murder happen,	   16371	Annabel Miller	490173	        103	          Franklin Ave	    318771143
       and I recognized the killer from my gym 
 when I was working out last week on January the 9th.
 
 That's it , found a clue regarding the murderer. He/she went to gym on January 9th.
 
 Now its time to find what the second witness had to say regarding the murderer. Used this simple query to retrieve the statement.
 
 select*
from interview
join person
on interview.person_id=person.id
where  address_street_name='Northwestern Dr'
order by address_number Desc
limit 1;

Result:-

person_id	                    transcript	                        id	      name	    license_id	address_number   	address_street_name	    ssn
  14887	    I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out.	      14887 	Morty Schapiro	118009	         4919	       Northwestern Dr	 111564949
         He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number 
      on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags.
      The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
  
Found most crucial clue regarding gym membership number and car plate number.

Retreiving data from get_fit_now_check_in table with the following query

select*
from get_fit_now_check_in
where check_in_date=20180109 and membership_id like "48Z%";

Result:- 

membership_id	check_in_date	check_in_time	check_out_time
   48Z7A	       20180109      	1600	         1730
   48Z55	       20180109      	1530	         1700

Not of much use.

Then the idea of joining get_fit_now_check_in and get_fit_now_member tables came and executed as below:

select*
from get_fit_now_check_in
join get_fit_now_member
on get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id=get_fit_now_member.id
where check_in_date=20180109 and membership_id like "48Z%";

Result:- 

membership_id	check_in_date	check_in_time	check_out_time	id	  person_id	    name    	membership_start_date	membership_status
    48Z7A       	20180109	    1600	         1730   	48Z7A    	28819	  Joe Germuska	       20160305	           gold
    48Z55	        20180109	    1530	         1700	    48Z55	    67318	  Jeremy Bowers	       20160101	           gold
    
    Narrowed down the investigation to two final suspects;  Joe and Jeremy.
    
Its time to use the car plate number clue to find the murderer..

I inner joined 4 tables get_fit_now_check_in,get_fit_now_member,person, drivers_license with a where clause as below

select get_fit_now_member.name
from get_fit_now_check_in
inner join get_fit_now_member
on get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id=get_fit_now_member.id
inner join person
on get_fit_now_member.name=person.name
inner join drivers_license
on person.license_id=drivers_license.id
where check_in_date=20180109 and membership_id like "48Z%" and plate_number like "%H42W%";    

Result:-

   name
Jeremy Bowers

The murderer was caught, thanks to SQL.


Next the challenge was to find the master mind behind this murder by using two queries only.

First we need to read the transcript of the murderer of his interview; we did by writing the query below...

select interview.transcript
from interview
join person
on interview.person_id=person.id
where name='Jeremy Bowers';

Result:- 

                                             transcript
I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

The second and final query to find the master mind behind the murder is as follows:

select person.name,facebook_event_checkin.date,facebook_event_checkin.event_name
from facebook_event_checkin
inner join person
on facebook_event_checkin.person_id=person.id
inner join drivers_license
on person.license_id=drivers_license.id
where car_make = "Tesla" and car_model="Model S" and gender = "female" and hair_color="red";

Result:- 

      name         	date	       event_name
Miranda Priestly	20171206	SQL Symphony Concert
Miranda Priestly	20171212	SQL Symphony Concert
Miranda Priestly	20171229	SQL Symphony Concert

The master mind behind the murder is Miranda Priestly
